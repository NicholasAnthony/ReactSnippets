react interview questions:

Lifecycle Methods:
componentWillMount() - doing some configuration of the root component
componentDidMount() - fetch data from a server - initialize anything that relies on the DOM - add event listeners
componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) - If you have a state that is a calculation from multiple props, you could do the calculation here.
shouldComponentUpdate(nextState, nextProps) -  check, if the update of props or state affect the output of the component and update depending
componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) - Not called for initial render - set a variable based on state changes - dispatching events - starting animations
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) - Perform network requests
componentWillUnmount() - removing event listeners you added in componentDidMount - cleaning up DOM elements - cancelling active network requests

What does setState do?
Starts reconciliation > construct a new tree of React elements (object representation of your UI) > React will diff this new tree against the previous element tree

What is the Virtual DOM?
  - A virtual DOM is a JavaScript object which originally is just the copy of the real DOM. It is a node tree that lists the elements & attributes and content as Objects & properties. 

React ES6 vs ES5?
  - require vs import • state • props • component and function  • export vs exports 

Differentiate between states and props?
￼

Differentiate between stateful and stateless components.?

List down the components of Redux.
  Action – It’s an object that describes what happened.
  Reducer –  It is a place to determine how the state will change.
  Store – State/ Object tree of the entire application is saved in the Store.
  View – Simply displays the data provided by the Store.

Explain the purpose of render() in React.
  - render() returns a single React element which is the representation of the native DOM component

Difference between an Element and a Component 
  - React element is an object representation of some UI.
  - React component is a function or a class which optionally accepts input and returns a React element

When would you use a Class Component over a Functional Component?
  - If your component has state or a lifecycle method(s), use a Class component. Otherwise, use a Functional component.

What are refs in React and why are they important?
  - to use them you add a ref attribute to your component whose value is a callback function which will receive the DOM element ref={(input) => this.input = input}
  - refs can also be used with functional components by leveraging closures in JavaScript `ref={(input) => inputElement = input}`
  - When you need to manage focus, select text or media playback  | To trigger imperative animations | Integrate with third-party DOM libraries

What are keys in React and why are they important?
  - Keys are what help React keep track of what items have changed, been added, or been removed from a list.
  -  React can use the key on a child element to quickly know if an element is new or if it was just moved when comparing trees

What is the render callback pattern?
  - When a component receives a function as its child

What is the difference between a controlled component vs uncontrolled component?
  - A controlled component is a component where React is in control and is the single source of truth for the form data.
  - An uncontrolled component is where your form data is handled by the DOM, instead of inside your React component use refs to accomplish this.

In which lifecycle event do you make AJAX requests and why?
  - AJAX requests should go in the componentDidMount lifecycle event.

How do you tell React to build in Production mode and what will that do?
  - Use Webpack’s DefinePlugin method to set NODE_ENV to production. Strips out things like propType validation and extra warnings. 

Describe how events are handled in React.
  - Event handlers in React will be passed instances of SyntheticEvent, React’s cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event.

What is the second argument that can optionally be passed to setState and what is its purpose?
   - A callback function which will be invoked when setState has finished and the component is re-rendered.
